Locale-Maketext-Gettext change log

2003-04-25	version 0.04
	Documentation fixes.  Upgrade is not required if you are
	using version 0.03.

2003-04-25	version 0.03
	Bug fixes.
	 1. Fixed clashing of the die_for_lookup_failures setting
	    from multiple instances.
	 2. Change log is rewritten, to my own format.
	 3. A new racing test suite is added.  The old racing test
	    suite was renamed as t-switching.
	 4. Redundant initialization of $LH->{"LOCALEDIRS"} in
	    bindtextdomain is removed.
	 5. An old line at die_for_lookup_failures which initialize
	    a wrong $LH->{"LOCALE"} is removed.
	 6. Removed 2 incorrect notice in the documentation.  There
	    will not be infinite loops for bindtextdomain and
	    textdomain, whatever value it takes.  Apparently I had
	    made a mistake. ^^;
	 7. Several typos in the comments are fixed.
	 8. Sanity checks to the MO file is moved into readmo().
	    Cache now has a higher precedence than the sanity checks,
	    which conforms with the global design.
	 9. More documentation was added to the SYNOPSIS.
	10. Sanity checks for whether a method is invoked as a static
	    method are added.  Maketext use static variables.  We
	    should not clash them.
	11. As a result of the above, the maketext method is no more
	    static.  It is an instance method, meaning that
	    MyPkg::L10N::en->maketext does not work anymore.
	12. Instance lexicon is initialized in the new method.  I
	    almost forgot it.  Thanks to the test suite. :p

2003-04-25	version 0.02
	Class/object design fixes.
	 1. I did tell the difference from class variables to
	    instance variables.  Forgive me, I had no experience
	    with object-oriented programming at all, not even OO for
	    perl. :p  Just a few Java books.  Anyway, the problem
	    with clashing class variables is fixed.  Most class
	    variables are moved into instance variables.
	 2. Solved the default output encoding problem by using the
	    encoding of the MO file as the default encoding.
	 3. reload_text method is added to purge the MO file cache,
	    so that applications do not need to be restarted when
	    their MO file updates.
         4. MO files of different byte orders are supported now.
	    Big-endian MO files support is added.
	 5. die_for_lookup_failures method was added.  The default
	    behavior changed to "never fails", as GNU gettext does.
	 6. A test suite is added.
