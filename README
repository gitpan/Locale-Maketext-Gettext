Locale::Maketext::Gettext brings GNU gettext and Maketext together.
It is a subclass of L<Locale::Maketext(3)|Locale::Maketext/3> that
follows the way GNU gettext works.  It works seamlessly, I<both in
the sense of GNU gettext and Maketext>.

You start as an usual GNU gettext localization project:  Work on
PO files with the help of translators, reviewers and Emacs.  Turn
them into MO files with F<msgfmt>.  Copy them into the appropriate
locale directory, such as
F</usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/myapp.mo>.

Then, build your Maketext localization class, with your base class
changed from L<Locale::Maketext(3)|Locale::Maketext/3> to
Locale::Maketext::Gettext.  That's all. ^_*'

* Installation

Locale::Maketext::Gettext uses the standard perl module install process:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

Sorry, its test suite is not available yet. :p  Someone may have to
teach me on this. *^_^*
