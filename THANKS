Thanks to Sean M. Burke, for writing such a great localization
framework as Locale::Maketext, especially for his ideas about
the plural forms.

Thanks to the GNU group, for writing such a great localization
framework as GNU gettext, especially for the completeness and
simplicity of its design.

Thanks for Autrijus Tang for writing Locale::Maketext::Lexicon.
It inspires me to import %Lexicon from other sources.  Also
thanks for approving such a project that is a contrary to his
own Locale::Maketext::Lexicon. :p

Finally, well, :p thanks to Larry Wall, for writing such a
great programming language, as perl.
