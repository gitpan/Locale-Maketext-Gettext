        o Release 0.02
        o Fixed the problem with clashing class variables.  Moved most
          class variables to instant variables.
        o Solved the default output encoding problem by using the encoding
          of the MO file as the default encoding.
        o reload_text method is added to purge the MO file cache, so that
          applications won't have to restart when their MO file updates.
        o Byte order of the MO files is detected now, and big-endian MO
          files support is added.
        o die_for_lookup_failures method was added.  The default behavior
          changes to "never fails", as GNU gettext does.
